## Real-Time Concentration Tracker üßê

This project presents a real-time concentration tracking system that leverages computer vision to monitor user focus during tasks. It analyzes facial cues from a webcam feed to provide immediate feedback and log concentration data for future analysis.

-----

## Features ‚ú®

  * **Real-Time Concentration Scoring:** Dynamically calculates a "Concentration Score" based on eye blinking, mouth movements, head pose, and gaze direction.
  * **Audible Alerts:** Triggers an alert sound when the concentration score consistently drops below a predefined threshold, prompting the user to refocus.
  * **Data Logging:** Records concentration data (timestamp, score, blinks, mouth opens, distractions) to a CSV file (`focus_log.csv`) for performance analysis over time.
  * **User Feedback:** Displays real-time concentration percentage, as well as "BLINKING" and "MOUTH OPEN" indicators on the video feed.

## How it Works üõ†Ô∏è

The system processes a live video stream from your webcam. Using **MediaPipe's Face Mesh solution**, it detects numerous facial landmarks. These landmarks are then used to compute:

  * **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR):** To determine if the eyes are closed (indicating a blink).
  * **Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR):** To detect if the mouth is open (indicating yawning or speaking).
  * **Head Pose Score:** Assesses if the head is oriented towards the screen.
  * **Gaze Score:** Estimates if the user's gaze is directed centrally.

These metrics are combined into a weighted **Concentration Score**. If this score remains low for a set duration, an alert is triggered. All data points are periodically saved to a log file.

## Installation üíª

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pandas pygame streamlit
    ```

4.  **Prepare the alert sound:**
    Place your `alert.wav` file in the same directory as the script. You can use any short, clear sound file.

## Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

This project includes **three distinct versions** of the concentration tracker, each offering unique features and functionalities.

### **1. Basic Concentration Tracker (`track_optimize.py`)**

This is the foundational version, providing real-time concentration monitoring with direct visual feedback and audio alerts.

  * **To run:**
    ```bash
    python track_optimize.py
    ```
  * **Features:** Displays concentration percentage, "BLINKING" and "MOUTH OPEN" status, and draws a dynamic concentration bar. It also features a maximum alert sound play duration.
  * **Interaction:** Press `q` to quit the application window.

### **2. Optimized Tracker with Threaded Camera (`optimization.py`)**

This version enhances performance by implementing **multi-threading** for camera capture, ensuring a smoother video feed and potentially more responsive processing, as video capture runs in a separate thread. This version focuses on the core tracking and visual feedback.

  * **To run:**
    ```bash
    python optimization.py
    ```
  * **Features:** Includes the core concentration scoring, basic visual indicators ("BLINKING", "MOUTH OPEN"), and a dynamic concentration bar.
  * **Interaction:** Press `q` to quit the application window.

### **3. Concentration Dashboard (`focus_dashboard.py`)**

This version is a **Streamlit-based web dashboard** that reads the `focus_log.csv` file generated by either of the tracking scripts. It provides a user-friendly interface to visualize your concentration trends and statistics over time. **You must run one of the tracking scripts (`track_optimize.py` or `optimization.py`) simultaneously to generate data for this dashboard.**

  * **To run:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run focus_dashboard.py
    ```
  * **Features:** Displays the latest concentration score, total blinks, mouth opens, and distractions. It also provides a **line chart** of the concentration score over time and a table of the most recent log entries.
  * **Interaction:** The dashboard automatically updates every 5 seconds. Access it through your web browser (URL provided in the terminal).

## Configuration (Optional) ‚öôÔ∏è

You can adjust the following parameters within the respective Python files to customize behavior:

  * `AlertSystem` `threshold`: The concentration score below which an alert state is initiated (default: 45%).
  * `AlertSystem` `time_limit`: The duration (in seconds) the score must remain below the threshold before an alert is triggered (default: 12 seconds).
  * `LOG_FILE`: The name of the CSV file where data is logged (default: "focus\_log.csv").
  * `alert_sound`: The filename of your alert sound (default: "alert.wav").
  * `AlertSystem` `max_play_time` (in `track_optimize.py`): Maximum duration the alert sound will play (default: 7 seconds).
